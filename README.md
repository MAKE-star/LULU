## 🌍 The Vision

Africa's informal economy employs **80% of the workforce**, yet lacks:
- ✅ Trust & verification systems
- ✅ Secure payment infrastructure  
- ✅ Financial inclusion pathways
- ✅ Safety mechanisms

**LULU solves this** by creating a trusted marketplace where:
- **Chefs, stylists, movers, handymen** get verified and find work
- **Customers** book with confidence using our Handshake™ system
- **Banks** gain access to credit-worthy informal workers

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 The LULU Handshake™
Our proprietary 3-step verification process:
1. **Match** - Browse verified profiles with real reviews
2. **Handshake** - 4-digit code exchange ensures right person arrived
3. **Confirm** - Escrow payment released only after job completion

### 🛡️ Trust & Safety
- Identity verification (Government ID + selfie)
- Background checks for all workers
- Real-time GPS tracking
- SOS emergency button
- AI-powered review monitoring

### 💰 Financial Inclusion
- **Trust Score** = Credit score for informal workers
- Instant payments to digital wallets
- Partnership with Access Bank & Interswitch
- Insurance coverage for every job
